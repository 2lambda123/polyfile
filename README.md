A utility to identify and map the semantic structure of files, including polyglots, chimeras, and schizophrenic files.

## Quickstart

In the same directory as this README, run:
```
pip3 install -e .
```

This will automatically install the `polyfile` executable in your path.

## Usage

```
$ polyfile --help
usage: polyfile [-h] [--html HTML] [--debug] [--quiet] FILE

A utility to recursively map the structure of a file.

positional arguments:
  FILE                  The file to analyze

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --html HTML, -t HTML  Path to write an interactive HTML file for exploring
                        the PDF
  --debug, -d           Print debug information
  --quiet, -q           Suppress all log output (overrides --debug)
```

To generate a JSON mapping of a file, run:

```
polyfile INPUT_FILE > output.json
```

You can optionally have PolyFile output an interactive HTML page containing a labeled, interactive hexdump of the file:
```
polyfile INPUT_FILE --html output.html > output.json
```

## File Support

PolyFile can identify all 10,000+ file formats in the [TrID database](http://mark0.net/soft-trid-deflist.html).
It currently has support for parsing and semantically mapping the following formats:
* PDF, using an instrumented version of [Didier Stevens' public domain, permissive, forensic parser](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/)
* ZIP, including reursive identification of all ZIP contents
* JPEG/JFIF, using its [Kaitai Struct grammar](https://formats.kaitai.io/jpeg/index.html)
* [iNES](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES)
* [Any other format](https://formats.kaitai.io/index.html) specified in a [KSY grammar](https://doc.kaitai.io/user_guide.html)

For an example that exercises all of these file formats, run:
```bash
curl -v --silent https://www.sultanik.com/files/ESultanikResume.pdf | polyfile --html ESultanikResume.html - > ESultanikResume.json
```
